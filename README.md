# My_AI: An AI-Powered Content & Code Generator

My_AI is a beginner-friendly AI assistant project that leverages state-of-the-art pre-trained models to perform text generation, code generation, and text-to-speech conversion. This project demonstrates how to use Hugging Face's `transformers` library to quickly integrate natural language processing (NLP) capabilities into Python scripts.

## Features

- **Text Generation**: Generates coherent and creative text based on user prompts using OpenAI's GPT-2 model.
- **Code Generation**: Uses Salesforce's CodeGen model to auto-generate Python code from function signatures or textual prompts.
- **Text-to-Speech (TTS)**: Converts any generated or custom text into audible speech using Google Text-to-Speech (`gTTS`).
